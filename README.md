# Autonomous-Car-Otonom-Araba-
Python openCV ile renkleri algılayıp komut alan araba. (sağa dönüş, sola dönüş, durma)- Autonomus car that senses colors by using OpenCV and moves according to them.(turning left, turning right and stop)

Proje hakkında detaylı rapor bulunmaktadır. Detay için rapora bakabilirsiniz.

# GOAL
The project aims to combine topics of electrical-electronics engineering (EEE) and computer
engineering (CoE) for the design of an autonomous car that can identify simple signs on a given
track and then make a decision whether to turn left/right or stop.


# PROJECT COMPONENTS:
The project involves hardware and software design components of EEE and CoE respectively.
The students are expected to have a functional hardware, or the autonomous car that will be
provided to students, and then target the hardware with the codes that they will develop.
Therefore, the students are expected to follow both parts of the course: Hardware + Software.
The course has 6 labs that will prepare the students for the hardware development. For the
software part the tools to recognize signs through machine learning and AI approaches will be
covered.


# PROJECT EVALUATION:
A group of typically three/four students will form a team. The group is expected to work on the
project from Week 3 of the classes. The groups will have three reports: The proposal report,
mid-report, and the final report. The groups will demonstrate their autonomous car in a given
track, which will be prepared by the course TA. A sample track is shown below. We plan to use
three different sign colors on the track: Red, Blue, and Green. Red means stop for 10 seconds,
Blue means turn left, and Green mean turn right. The autonomous car should be in front of the
track and will start with a red sign, it then should complete the track without passing over the
lines drawn on both sides of the road. The autonomous car will be expected to complete the
track in a specified time period. The width of the track will be 50 cm and the sign will have a
diameter of 20 cm. The signs will be on both sides of the track for simplicity, 5 cm away from the
track lines. The lines on the track will be colored with white color, while the road color will be in
black. We will have dashed orange lines in the middle of the track.
The track will be prepared by the TA and will be made available for testing by the 6th week of
the classes. A sample track is shown in the following figure.
Please note that we can make slight changes on the track. However, you will be notified of any
changes and this project description document will be updated accordingly.


The autonomous car performance and the reports of the project will determine the final mark of
the students from the project.
